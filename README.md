# Utility-Customer-Behavior-Analysis

Project prompt: Assume that you are working as a data analyst at a utility company. Your department has designed a survey study to inspect different attributes of the company's end-users. The study has multiple objectives with respect to environmental awareness, willingness towards participating in demand side management (DSM) programs, consumption habits, and indoor thermal comfort perceptions. 

My analysis included the following focus areas:
- Hypothesis testing on the ratio of respondents concerend about environmental issues to see if we can say with 95% certainty that more respondents are concerned about the environment than apathetic or not
- Training and applying a random forest classifier to predict which respondents would be concerned about environmental issues
- Training and applying a random forest classifier to predict which respondent indoor temperature preferences
- Manipulating the data to translate the comfort rating and valuation of indoor temperature prefence into a categorical (qualitative) variable. I then used this to compare by gender the indoor temperature preferences
- Identifying which independent variables have the largest impact on an individual's willingness to participate in DSM (demand-side mgmt) programs
- Creating a new column regarding house sizing, dropping nulls, and identifying the feature strength in helping to classify DSM willingness
- Identifying which features are most strongly important in predicting monthly consumption of energy

  Tools utilized: matplotlib, pandas, pyplot, scikit-learn

  This project highlights my competency with ML, visualization, and data manipulation in Python. It also highlights my statistical and ML theory experience.
